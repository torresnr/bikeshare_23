Final project: generating problems
1. Holiday sales
Is there increased ridership during holiday season? 
If not, how can we improve ridership during this time?

External datasets we can use:
  Travel to and away from DC to estimate the population at the time
  Metro travel in DC during the holiday season to compare with (does the overall travel go down or up?)
  Possible car rentals in DC during the holiday season
  Commuting Flows for DC during the holiday season
  Months: April, July and December for 2020,2021 & 2022
  
Generating a solution: Look at other transportation companies, what did they do over the holidays to raise the ridership? Can we apply those to this?

2. Improving ridership but using the holiday data:
  - Holiday data shows tourists and not locals (since most probably use the program to commute to and from work, holiday season means no work and people tend to stay home with family around Christmas time), how do tourists affect the ridership program?
  - We can use the data from this and other holidays to see how much tourist affect bikeshare sales
  - Then we can generate something to help increase usage of bikes for tourists.
  
What we want: Improve overall money in by taking advantage of tourists during holiday seasons. 
- Identify when tourists come the most (holiday season)
- Identify hotspots for tourists and compare if there is public transport to that location or if there is a bikestation there
- Identify the usage of those locations during different seasons (non tourist seasons and tourist seasons)
- Find car rentals to see how much that affects tourists using the bikeshare program (is it worth it to put more stations?)
- Generate ideas for where to put more stations/what to do to increase tourist ridership
