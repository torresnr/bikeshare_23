# Report
Our idea is to collect the bikeshare data and taxi rider data for the years of 2020 and 2022. 2020 will serve as our year where travel has been affected by covid and 2022 will be our year where the effects from covid are small. We will view each month individually and specifically in the peak months of covid in 2020 to see how travel is changed while people are trying to avoid cramped public transportation. Based on these findings, we will draw conclusions on how covid affected “for hire” transportation in DC.

While working with our data, we realized that the month of January in 2020 is missing the start times and end times for the bikes. Due to this complication and no way to add these times, we excluded January 2020 and January 2022 data from our graphs.
