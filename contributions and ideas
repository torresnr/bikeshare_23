Our goal is to find how the holidays affect ridership for the DC bike share company.
We decided to use the month of March as a control month. March does not contain any holidays that people travel for or get time off for. It also does not have a significant 
increase in good weather. This allows us to have it as a neutral month to compare to holiday months. We selected July, April, and December as our holiday months.
We are going to compile the metro data and the rental car data to see if there are any spikes in data compared to March. Based on this observation, we will then compare
it to the bikeshare data compiled for those months. If the metro and rental data increase, but the bikeshare data does not, we can conclude that travelers/vacationers
are traveling to DC, but are not using the bikeshare system. If the metro, rental, and bikeshare data increase, we can conclude that holidays/vacations provide
good new business for the DC bikeshare program.


Step 1) we all worked together to come up with our idea
Step 2) we created a data_raw file in our github repository to compile all of the neccecary data regarding the metro, bikeshare, and rental car information for the chosen
        months
Step 3)
